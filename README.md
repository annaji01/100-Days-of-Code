# 100-Days-of-Code üë®üèª‚Äçüíª
Here I will share my 100 days of code in which I will solve Data Structure and Algorithms questions each day 2 although I will learning new things on daily basis, which I'll upload here on this repository.

## Day 1Ô∏è‚É£:-

  ### **ABOUT DSA (Linked List)**
 * Today, I created new linked list file and learn about Linked List's all basics, types etc.

```
  Q1 What is Linked list?
  Ans. The chunks of nodes are connected with another nodes by the reference which is already present into the node, and also this nodes are located on different memory locations, that is known as linked list.
   Every node contains two things first is data and second is reference.

  Q2 What are the types of linked list?
  Ans. There are three types of linked list
       1. Singly Linked List
       2. Doubly Linked List
       3. Circular Linked List
```

 * Learnt about how to
   - *Create a Linked List in **JAVA***
   - *Insert a node*
   - *Delete a node*
   - *Edit a node*
   - *Print a Linked List*
   
 * I also solved some questions on singly linked list and that questions are mentioned below :-
    ~~~
    1. 1
    2. 2

  ### **ABOUT NEXT.JS**
  * I worked on `next.js` and I learnt
    - How to create a new `next.js` project
      > *npx create-next-app ($Name_of_folder)*

    - If you don't want to create an another folder and create a project in that folder only so, type this command.
        > *npx create-next-app ./*  

    - Also studied about folder heredity.

## Day 2Ô∏è‚É£ :-


> ***NOTE*** :- We can open vscode in browser directly with repository by pressing dot (.) key on keyboard.


### About DSA (Binary Search) 

#### **Learnt about Binary Search** :-
  
  It is an algorithm to find the target element into the given `sorted array` with the time complexity of **( log n )**. This is an very optimize way to find the element into the array.

 Here is your üëâüèª **[Code](https://github.com/dsrathore1/100-Days-of-Code/blob/main/JAVA/Binary_Search.java)**

  - Some Questions :-

    1. [Implement Binary Search](https://github.com/dsrathore1/100-Days-of-Code/blob/main/JAVA/Binary_Search.java)
    2. [Search an element in a reverse sorted array](https://github.com/dsrathore1/100-Days-of-Code/blob/main/JAVA/Search_In_Descending_order.java)
    3. [Order Agnostic Binary Search](https://github.com/dsrathore1/100-Days-of-Code/blob/main/JAVA/Order-agnostic-search.java)

## Day 3Ô∏è‚É£ :-

### Started Tailwind CSS

#### Learnt about how to install & configure

It is very easy to learn but there is one **Pre-requisite** is CSS which I know before it, So tailwind css is little bit easy for me. I am learning and creating a project in the reference of `Traversy Media YouTube channel`.

There are several steps to install tailwind css
