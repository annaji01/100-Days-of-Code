# 100-Days-of-Code
Here I will share my 100 days of code in which I will solve Data Structure and Algorithms questions each day 2 although I will learning new things on daily basis, which I'll upload here on this repository.

## Day 1 :-

  ### **ABOUT DSA (Linked List)**
 * Today, I created new linked list file and learn about Linked List's all basics, types etc.

```
  Q1 What is Linked list?
  Ans. The chunks of nodes are connected with another nodes by the reference which is already present into the node, and also this nodes are located on different memory locations, that is known as linked list.
   Every node contains two things first is data and second is reference.

  Q2 What are the types of linked list?
  Ans. There are three types of linked list
       1. Singly Linked List
       2. Doubly Linked List
       3. Circular Linked List
```

 * Learnt about how to
   - *Create a Linked List in **JAVA***
   - *Insert a node*
   - *Delete a node*
   - *Edit a node*
   - *Print a Linked List*
   
 * I also solved some questions on singly linked list and that questions are mentioned below :-
    ~~~
    1. 1
    2. 2

  ### **ABOUT NEXT.JS**
  * I worked on `next.js` and I learnt
    - How to create a new `next.js` project
      > *npx create-next-app ($Name_of_folder)*

    - If you don't want to create an another folder and create a project in that folder only so, type this command.
        > *npx create-next-app ./*  

    - Also studied about folder heredity.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
